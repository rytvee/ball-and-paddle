## ðŸŽ® Gameplay Overview

| Part                   | Role                                                                                          |

| **Ball**               | Moves up/down & bounces off walls and paddle. Position updates using `requestAnimationFrame`. |
| **Paddle**             | Controlled by user (move left/right or up/down depending on implementation).                  |
| **Collision Logic**    | Detects overlap between ball and paddle or walls. Reverses direction upon impact.             |
| **Scoring (optional)** | Could be added to track missed hits or keep points.                                           |
